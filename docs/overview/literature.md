# Paper Sumarries

### [Sim-to-Real via Sim-to-Sim: Data-efficient Robotic Grasping via Randomized-to-Canonical Adaptation Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.07252.pdf) <a name="ref1"></a>

**Usecase** Robotic Grasping

**Year** 2019

**TLDR** Randomized to-Canonical Adaptation Networks (RCANs): learns to translate randomized rendered images into their equivalent non-randomized, canonical versions.Achieving 91% grasp performance with just 5,000 real-world grasps attaining comparable performance to a state-of-the-art system
trained with 580,000 real-world grasps, resulting in a reduction of real-world data by more than 99%.
