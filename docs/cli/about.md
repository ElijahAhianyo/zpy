# zpy cli

The zpy cli is a **C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface to interact with datasets and [sims](https://zumolabs.github.io/zpy/zpy/tutorials/what_is_a_sim/) on the zumo labs backend. This CLI has much of the same functionality found in the [WebApp](https://zumolabs.github.io/zpy/app/about/), but allows developers to use command line instead of a GUI to interact with datasets and sims.

### Usage

* [zpy login](login.md) - Authenticate with backend. 
* [zpy list](list.md) - List objects from backend.
* [zpy get](get.md) - Download objects from backend.
* [zpy upload](upload.md) - Upload files and [sims](https://zumolabs.github.io/zpy/zpy/tutorials/what_is_a_sim/) to backend.
* [zpy create](create.md) - Create objects on backend to trigger workflows.
* [zpy logs](logs.md) - Fetch logs for backend workflows.
