# Install the Blender Addon

Once you have installed the `zpy` module into Blender's python, download the latest [zip](https://github.com/ZumoLabs/zpy/releases) (you want the one called `zpy_addon-v*.zip`). Then open up Blender. Navigate to `Edit` -> `Preferences` -> `Add-ons`. You should be able to install and enable the addon from there.
