# zpy cli

The zpy cli is a **C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface to interact with datasets and sims on the zumo labs backend. This CLI has much of the same functionality found in the WebApp, but allows developers to use command line instead of a GUI to interact with datasets and sims.

```
pip install zpy-zumo
```

### Usage

* [zpy login](login.md) - Authenticate with backend. 
* [zpy list](list.md) - List objects from backend.
* [zpy get](get.md) - Download objects from backend.
* [zpy upload](upload.md) - Upload files and sims to backend.
* [zpy create](create.md) - Create objects on backend to trigger workflows.
* [zpy logs](logs.md) - Fetch logs for backend workflows.
