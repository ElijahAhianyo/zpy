A simulation, also known as "sim", is a scriptable 3D environment that is created using the zpy tools and Blender. A sim have the following principal components:

- `run.py` - The main script executed at runtime which creates and controls the 3D environment.
- `config.gin` - An optional configuration file which allows custom configuration at runtime.
- `main.blend` - The primary blenderfile which contains the run script.
