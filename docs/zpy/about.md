# Abstract

`zpy` is a python package that makes synthetic data easy, by simplifying the process of creating simulations, or [sims](https://zumolabs.github.io/zpy/zpy/tutorials/what_is_a_sim/). The `zpy` module contains multiple pieces:

- A [Blender Addon](../../addon/about) for creating and debugging [sims](https://zumolabs.github.io/zpy/zpy/tutorials/what_is_a_sim/) inside the Blender UI.
- A [CLI](../../cli/about/) for things like uploading [sims](https://zumolabs.github.io/zpy/zpy/tutorials/what_is_a_sim/) and generating datasets.
- A [WebApp](../../app/about/) for a GUI version of the API and CLI.
- A [Client API](../../client_api/about/) for generating synthetic datasets.
