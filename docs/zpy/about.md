We created `zpy` to make synthetic data easy, by simplifying the simulation (sim) creation process and providing an easy way to generate synthetic data at scale. Using `zpy` you can add variation to a blender scene and segment and add annotations to the scene. This module also provides framework for generating the images at scale using the Zumo Labs backend.
