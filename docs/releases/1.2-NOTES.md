**Features:**

- Added support for Blender 2.93.
- Added initial support for payment accounts and projects for better grouping of related objects. All `zpy create` 
  calls will now require a project namespace to be set via `zpy project set`.
- Added more informative error messages for known API errors (HTTP code 400).
- Added more informative print of filtered data sets before the confirmation message when doing `zpy create job`.

**Fixes:**

- Standardized column widths for `zpy list` calls to prevent clipping of UUIDs and dates.
