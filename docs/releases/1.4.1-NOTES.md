**Features:**

- `client.generate`
    - \***Removed**\* positional `name` parameter. Unique dataset names will be generated automatically behind the 
      scenes based on the generate parameters.
    - \***Changed**\* key word argument `materialize` to `download`.
    - \***Fixed**\* calls with a configuration for a dataset that has already been generated. Regeneration will not 
      occur, and the dataset will be immediately downloaded if it does not already exist locally.
    - \***Added**\* new parameter called `dataset_callback`. It will be called once per dataset. Example use-case: 
      save the dataset exactly how you want it. 
    - \***New default behavior**\* If no `dataset_callback` is provided, the dataset will be flattened into a single 
      directory.

**Fixes:**

- Project members now have appropriate access to datasets and sims contained in their projects.
