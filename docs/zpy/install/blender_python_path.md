# Blender's Python Path

Blender comes with it's own Python, which is bundled with the 3D program. When installing python dependencies, such as 'zpy' a common mistake is to install them on the system python rather than Blender's python.

More information on the install paths for Blender on various OS can be found in [Blender's path documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/advanced/blender_directory_layout.html)

### Linux

If you are running Blender directly from the install folder, you can find the python and pip executables in the `blender-2.93.0-linux64/2.93/python/bin/` folder.

### Windows

On Windows, Blender's python path can be found in the program files directory `C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender 2.93\2.93\python\bin`
